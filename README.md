# CatTrax

CatTrax is a simple cat manager mobile app that allows a user to add, view, update, and delete cats. This application was built using React Native, Expo, and React Native Paper.

## Features

- View a list of all added cats sorted by name or breed in alphabetical order or by age in ascending or descending order

- Add a cat to the list with its details: name, breed, age, favorite foods, description, and an image

- View a cat including all its details

- Edit a cat's details

- Remove a cat from the list

## Installation

To install and run this app, you will need Node.js, Expo CLI, and all app dependencies installed on your computer. Globally install Expo CLI by running `npm install -g expo-cli`. Next, clone the repo and run `npm install` to install all required app dependencies. Start the development server by running `npx expo start`. If this command does not work, try running `npx expo start --tunnel` as sometimes router configurations might be the issue. Download the Expo Go app on your phone and scan the QR code shown in the terminal. Please reference the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) for troubleshooting.
